Look to La Luna
Don't leave the house today
We will all die one day
You are throwing your life away
Go outside!
Give up!
You will die alone
Ask again later
Wake up
You are worshiping a sun god
Stay asleep
Marry and reproduce
Question authority
Think for yourself
Steven lives
Bring him the photo
Your soul is hidden deep within the darkness
You were born wrong
You are dark inside
You will never be forgiven
When life gives you lemons, reroll!
It is dangerous to go alone
Go to the next room
You will die
Why so blue?
Your princess is in another castle
You make mistakes, it is only natural
A hanged man brings you no luck today
The devil in disguise
Nobody knows the troubles you have seen
Do not look so hurt, others have problems too
Always your head in the clouds
Do not lose your head
Do not cry over spilled tears
Well that was worthless
Sunrays on your little face
Have you seen the exit?
Always look on the bright side
Get a baby pet, it will cheer you up
Meet strangers without prejudice
Only a sinner
See what he sees, do what he does
Lies
Lucky numbers: 16 31 64 70 74
Go directly to jail
Rebirth got cancelled
Follow the cat
You look fat, you should exercise more
Take your medicine
Come to a fork in the road, take it
Believe in yourself
Trust no one
Trust good people
Follow the dog
Follow the zebra
What do you want to do today
Use bombs wisely
Live to die
You are playing it wrong, give me the controller
Choose your own path
Your old life lies in ruin
I feel asleep!!!
May your troubles be many
Blame nobody but yourself
